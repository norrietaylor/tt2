# Smoke Test: Workflow Call Checkout Validation

This workflow is designed to be called via `workflow_call` from another workflow (e.g., `smoke-trigger`).
It validates that the PR branch checkout works correctly when invoked in a `workflow_call` context.

## Test Requirements

1. **Git Status**: Run `git status` to verify the workspace is properly initialized.
2. **Branch Check**: Run `git branch --show-current` to confirm which branch is checked out.
3. **Remote Check**: Run `git remote -v` to confirm the remote configuration.
4. **Log Check**: Run `git log --oneline -3` to verify the commit history is available.

## Output

Add a comment summarizing the checkout validation results:
- Current branch name
- Whether the workspace is clean or has changes
- Whether the checkout succeeded (based on git commands working without errors)
- Overall status: ✅ PASS or ❌ FAIL

**Important**: If no action is needed after completing your analysis, you **MUST** call the `noop` safe-output tool with a brief explanation. Failing to call any safe-output tool is the most common cause of safe-output workflow failures.

```json
{"noop": {"message": "No action needed: [brief explanation of what was analyzed and why]"}}
```
